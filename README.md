# SQL and Python for Enhanced Email Marketing Strategies 

Goal -Enabling **personalized** email marketing strategies in order to boost customer **engagement** and **sales**. 

1) **SEGMENTATION WITH SQL** The first step is to understand customer types by using SQL and dividing a dataset into distinct groups or segments based on predefined criteria or characteristics. It is a big help for **targeted email marketing**, enhancing message relevance and sales. 

2) **CLUSTERING WITH PYTHON** The second step is to use Python's **machine learning** algorithms tag and cluster customers. This technique used to automatically group similar customers together based on their inherent patterns or similarities, without prior knowledge or predefined criteria. Clustering also can help identify high-value customer segments with a higher potential for long-term profitability (CLV- Customer Lifetime Value). Clustering is often used in exploratory data analysis, pattern recognition, and anomaly detection.


**Comments on functionality**

## SQL
SQL helps manage data and can be used in marketing to segment your customer database based on different factors like buying habits, demographics, or customer preferences. This segmentation allows for more personalized and effective marketing messages. For example, you can identify and target customers who often buy a certain product category. 

## Python
Python can be used for data analysis and **machine learning**. It allows you to tag customers based on their behavior or traits using algorithms. For instance, you can group similar customers or predict customer behavior. Python can also be used to analyze and visualize customer data, and even use social media data for marketing insights. Phyton also automates email marketing reports and analytics by integrating with platforms and APIs, enabling data extraction, analysis, and generation of customized reports on key metrics like open rates, click-through rates, and conversions.

By using SQL and Python together, you can create a robust personalized marketing system. You can segment your customers with SQL, then analyze their behavior and tag them for more personalization using Python. This method can help you send more relevant messages to your customers, leading to improved **sales** and customer satisfaction.

THE PROCESS 

1) **SEGMENTATION WITH SQL**To perform customer segmentation using SQL, follow these steps:

Step 1: Define the Segmentation Criteria:

Determine the criteria or characteristics you want to use for segmenting the customers. This could include demographic information, purchase behavior, engagement metrics, or any other relevant factors.
Step 2: Gather and Prepare the Data:

Ensure you have the necessary customer data stored in a SQL database table. The data should include the attributes required for segmentation, such as customer identifiers, demographic information, and transactional data.
Step 3: Write SQL Queries for Segmentation:

Write SQL queries that define the criteria and rules for segmenting the customers. Use appropriate SQL functions and clauses to filter and group the data based on the segmentation criteria.
Step 4: Segment the Customers:

Execute the SQL queries to segment the customers based on the defined criteria. This will result in distinct groups or segments within the dataset.
Step 5: Analyze and Evaluate the Segments:

Analyze each segment by calculating relevant metrics and performing aggregations using SQL functions. Evaluate the characteristics, behaviors, and patterns of each segment to gain insights.
Step 6: Assign Segment Labels:

Based on the analysis and evaluation, assign meaningful labels or names to each segment to easily identify and reference them in future marketing activities.
Step 7: Apply the Segmentation Insights:

Utilize the segmented customer groups in your targeted email marketing campaigns. Craft tailored messages, offers, or promotions specific to each segment's characteristics and preferences to enhance message relevance and improve sales.

Step 8: Monitor and Refine:

Continuously monitor the performance of your segmentation strategy and refine it as needed. Collect feedback, analyze campaign results, and make adjustments to optimize the effectiveness of your targeted email marketing efforts.
By using SQL to segment customers, you can divide your dataset into distinct groups based on predefined criteria or characteristics. This segmentation helps in targeted email marketing by enhancing message relevance and driving sales.

Business Goals:

**Identify opportunities for cross-selling and upselling. 

Cross-Selling and Upselling Opportunities: By analyzing purchase behavior within clusters, you can identify opportunities for cross-selling and upselling. For example, customers within a specific segment might be more inclined to purchase complementary products or upgrade their purchases.

1st step - FEATURE ENGINEERING 
Here are some examples of feature engineering that you can perform on your dataset to identify opportunities for cross-selling and upselling:

Total Purchase Amount: Calculate the total purchase amount for each customer by multiplying the Unit Price and Quantity ordered new columns. This feature represents the overall spending behavior of customers and can help identify high-value customers.

Purchase Frequency: Determine the frequency of purchases for each customer by counting the number of unique Order ID values associated with their Customer ID. This feature indicates how often a customer makes purchases and can reveal their engagement level.

Average Discount: Calculate the average discount for each customer by taking the mean of the Discount column grouped by Customer ID. This feature helps identify customers who frequently take advantage of discounts and may respond well to targeted upselling offers.

Popular Product Category: Identify the most frequently purchased product category for each customer by analyzing the Product Category column. This feature helps identify cross-selling opportunities by suggesting complementary products within the same category.

Product Sub-Category Diversity: Count the number of unique Product Sub-Category values for each customer. This feature represents the diversity of products purchased by a customer and can indicate their openness to trying new products or exploring different sub-categories.

Shipping Cost Ratio: Calculate the ratio of Shipping Cost to the total purchase amount for each customer. This feature helps identify customers who are sensitive to shipping costs and may respond well to incentives like free shipping or discounted shipping rates.

Time Between Order and Shipment: Calculate the time difference (in days) between the Order Date and Ship Date for each order. Aggregate this value to determine the average time it takes to fulfill orders for each customer. This feature can highlight customers who value quick order processing and prompt delivery.

**Python Code 

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Read the data from the SQL database
df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM us_store", engine)

# Calculate Total Purchase Amount
df['Total Purchase Amount'] = df['unit_price'] * df['quantity_ordered_new']

Once you have performed feature engineering on your dataset, you can use various techniques in Python to identify opportunities for cross-selling and upselling. Here are a few approaches you can consider:

Market Basket Analysis: Market Basket Analysis is a popular technique for identifying cross-selling opportunities. It involves analyzing the co-occurrence of products in customer transactions to determine which items are frequently purchased together. You can use Python libraries such as mlxtend or apyori to perform market basket analysis and extract association rules that indicate cross-selling opportunities.

Collaborative Filtering: Collaborative Filtering is a recommendation technique that can be used for both cross-selling and upselling. It involves analyzing the purchase history and preferences of similar customers to make personalized recommendations. Python libraries like Surprise and TensorRec provide implementations of collaborative filtering algorithms that can help identify cross-selling and upselling opportunities.

Product Association Analysis: Apart from market basket analysis, you can perform product association analysis using techniques like Apriori algorithm or FP-Growth algorithm. These algorithms help identify frequently occurring itemsets and generate association rules that indicate relationships between products. These rules can be used to suggest cross-selling opportunities based on the customer's current purchase.

Customer Segmentation: Once you have engineered relevant features, you can apply clustering algorithms, such as K-means, DBSCAN, or hierarchical clustering, to segment your customers based on their purchasing behavior. By identifying distinct customer segments, you can tailor cross-selling and upselling strategies for each group. Python libraries like scikit-learn and KMeans can be used for customer segmentation.

Recommender Systems: Building recommender systems can also help in identifying cross-selling and upselling opportunities. Collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques can be applied to recommend complementary products or upgrades to customers based on their preferences and purchase history. Python libraries like LightFM and implicit provide implementations for building recommender systems.
